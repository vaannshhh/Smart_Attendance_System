**Smart Attendance System**

**Overview**

This project is an IoT-based Smart Attendance System that uses RFID, Face Recognition, and GPS to track and manage attendance automatically. It improves accuracy, security, and efficiency compared to traditional methods.

**Features**

**-RFID-based identification:** Users scan their RFID cards to mark attendance.

**-Face recognition verification:** Prevents proxy attendance by verifying users' faces.

**-GPS location tracking:** Ensures attendance is marked only in the designated area.

**-Cloud storage:** Stores attendance records for easy access and reporting.

**-Automated reporting:** Generates attendance reports for organizations.

**How It Works**

-A user scans their RFID card at the attendance system.

-The system captures the user's face image and verifies it with stored data.

-The GPS module ensures the user is at the correct location.

-Attendance is recorded in real-time and stored in a cloud-based database.

-Administrators can view reports and manage attendance data.

**System Components**

**RFID Reader & Tags -** Used for quick identification.

**Face Recognition Camera -** Verifies users' identities.

**GPS Module -** Ensures attendance is marked in the right location.

**Microcontroller (ESP8266 or similar) -** Manages communication between components.

**Cloud Database -** Stores attendance records securely.

**Installation & Setup**

**Hardware Setup:** Connect RFID reader, camera, and GPS module to the microcontroller.

**Software Setup:**

Install required libraries for RFID, face recognition, and GPS.

Configure the cloud database.

Deploy the software on the microcontroller.

**Testing:** Ensure each component functions correctly and data is recorded in real-time.

**Benefits**

Prevents proxy attendance with biometric verification.

Reduces manual work by automating attendance tracking.

Enhances security with real-time monitoring.

Scalable for schools, offices, and organizations.

**Future Improvements**
Improve face recognition under different lighting conditions.

Enhance GPS accuracy in weak signal areas.

Add Wi-Fi-based tracking for better location detection.

**Conclusion**

This IoT-based Smart Attendance System is a modern solution to efficiently track attendance with high accuracy and security. By combining RFID, Face Recognition, and GPS, it ensures reliable and fraud-free attendance monitoring.
